After few hours became little bit boring. Technically is amazing. Soundtrack very good. Very interesting setup. NOW.... The world feels dead. There IS no animals or live at all quite por for a ps5 game. Very repetitive and tedious. And the worst part of the Game are the cinematics OMG soooooo many and sooooo long. Looks more a movie than a video Game. Quite disappointing
