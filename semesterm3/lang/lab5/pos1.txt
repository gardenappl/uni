First, do not believe the negative comments about this being a walking simulator. It might feel that way at first, but if you get past the introduction and early game, there is much more to the game. You are frequently presented with new challenges and there are boss fights. You will gain new tools to overcome these challenges and even fight back. You can set up routes to help other porters get by and once you connect a zone, you can use the things other players set up to traverse terrain. The key, though, is you have to take your time and these features will unfold as you go.
