I have to give credit to Hideo Kojima for trying to make something different. For me it didn\u2019t pay off, but I did feel there were moments of brilliance here and there. Death Stranding is an ambitious game, but it\u2019s also one that\u2019s self-indulgent and overwrought. With better pacing and the excising of some of its less flattering content and features, Death Stranding could have been something special. As it is, however, it\u2019s just a slog that ultimately turns around and spits in your face.
